# Movie-recommendation-system
A Content-Based Movie Recommender System suggests movies by analyzing the features of the movies a user likesâ€”such as genres, keywords, cast, and overview. It creates a profile for each movie using text-based features and calculates similarity between them using cosine similarity technique. When a user selects a movie, the system recommends similar ones based on content, without needing user ratings or history.
